# Density Hangs
+ Choose 2 - 3 hold positions for training. Consider:
  + Slopers
  + Half crimp
  + Open hand
  + Full-crimp
  + Pinch (you may use pinch blocks)
+ For each position, choose a hold on which you can hang with two arms between 20 and 45 seconds, ideally without added load.
+ Perform a set of Density Hangs:
  + Hang for 20 - 40 seconds.
  + Rest for 10 - 20 seconds - use 1:2 hang to rest ratio.
  + Perform 2 - 3 reps - until you fail.
  + If you can do more than 3 reps, you can add 1 – 2 more, or increase the duration of the last rep until you fail.
+ Rest 3 - 5 minutes
+ Repeat the set for the same hold position or move to the next position.
+ For each hold position, perform 2 - 3 sets. That amounts to 4 - 9 sets per training session.
  + According to Dr. Nelson, doing 8 sets is often the ideal training volume.

+ Focus on slow static loading until muscular failure
+ Density hangs are ideally performed without added load, at around 75% of maximum strength (MVC-7)
  + To calculate your Density Hangs loads and training edge sizes, you may use my Hangboard Training Calculator [9].
  + Strong athletes should consider doing multiple reps until failure (Repeater style) instead of adding load - 1:2 hang to rest ratio works well in this case.
  + If you are strong enough, you may experiment with one arm hangs - it may be necessary to use a pulley setup or a rubber band for assistance.
  + It is better to use relatively large edges (20 - 35 mm) to reduce the risk of finger injury.
+ Progress by increasing the time to failure on the chosen edge size or drop the edge size if you can hit 30-seconds easily.
  + Be careful not to overdo training on small edges – it puts a lot of stress on the fingers, particularly at high training volumes.
+ To add variety to your hangboard sessions and to maintain an elevated heart rate, you can make circuits, to include lower extremity and upper extremity (bar isometrics) workouts in between individual hangs.
+ A typical training cycle is 4 – 5 weeks.

# Density Hangs (Nelson)
+ 4-9x 2-3x 20-40:10-20:180-300s
+ Hang:Rest = 1:2 Ratio
+ MVC-7 load	55 - 85%
   Density hangs are ideally performed without added load, at around 75% of maximum strength (MVC-7)
+ A typical training cycle is 4 – 5 weeks.
